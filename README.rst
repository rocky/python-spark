SPARK
=====

SPARK is an Early Algorithm Parser with some Generic Abstract Syntax
Tree building routines.

SPARK stands for the Scanning, Parsing, and Rewriting Kit.
The first version (circa 1998) was described in the paper Compiling
Little Languages in Python at the 7th International Python Conference.



Installation
------------

This uses setup.py, so it follows the standard Python routine:

::

    python setup.py install # may need sudo
    # or if you have pyenv:
    python setup.py develop
