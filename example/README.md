Some of examples of using SPARK.

Two show off the classic expression parsing. [`expr`](http://github.com/rocky/python-spark/tree/master/example/expr) is the simpler of the two:
it's everything all rolled into one file

[`expr2`](http://github.com/rocky/python-spark/tree/master/example/expr2) has more complete grammar rules. And the scanner is split off
from the parser.

The largest and more complete example is
[`python2`](http://github.com/rocky/python-spark/tree/master/example/python2)
a formatter for Python 2.6. It reads in valid Python 2.6, parses it
and builds an abstract syntax tree. Then it prints it back out
according to some table-driven formatting rules. It is left
incomplete.

After you've mastered this, consider going onto
[uncompyle6](http://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6) which turns Python
bytecode back into Python.

[fl_convert](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyfltk/files/flconvert/flconvert-0.1a2/) uses the original spark code to parse Fast Light ToolKit's GUI builder files and generate Python code.

There is plenty of room improvement for each program, but that is
somewhat deliberate. The hope is that you'll modify these to
improve them and understand how things work.

And if you have improvements or other examples, pass them along and
we'll add them.
