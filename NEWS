spark 1.6.0 2016-01-30

- Add ability to track grammar coverage
- Add ability to remove a grammar rule

spark 1.5.2 2017-01-27

- Fix bug in dumpGrammar()
- print routines take an optional I/O parameter
- Correct Jay Earley's name

spark 1.5.1 2016-11-27 johnnybamazing

- Add add limited Kleene closure symbols *, +, and optional suffix ?
  in grammar rules.
- Use these to simplify Python2 grammar
- Improve coverage in tests of Python2 grammar
- Start a NEW-FEATURES file
- Error if start symbol is not on LHS of grammar
- Check for totally recursive rules

spark 1.5.0 2016-11-26

- User-definable reduction check. This
  allows one to specify an additional check before
  a rediction is made. For example in uncompyle6 we
  check whether a SETUP_LOOP target jumps to the last
  token of the rule. Or that an augmented assignment statement
  doesn't have inplace-binary operators

- User defined reduce printing rule. For example, the uncompyle6 token
  class has line numbers and offsets associated with them. We can
  show these as part of the reduction rule.

- Go over python 2 grammar and improve, but some indentation things are slightly worse. Sigh.

- spark.py Fix small python2 print bug

spark 1.4.3 2016-11-22

- handle Python 2.3 via the 2.4 branch

  to 'dup'

spark 1.4.2 2016-11-22

- Fix botched release
- handle Python 2.5 via the 2.4 branch

- update example doc

spark 1.4.0 2016-06-22

- Add a grammar checker
- Improve AST printing
- More complete examples
  * More complete Python 2 example
  * expr2 example does evaluation


spark 1.3.0 2016-06-08

- Incompatible change: error now returns token stack
  and index rather than just the error token
- add debug options 'context' to show tokens around
  the error token
- More useful GenericToken class that works better with the
  table-driven AST routines often used.
- Add GenericParser().dumpgrammar to show grammar rules
- Add Python2 parser example


spark 1.2.1 2016-05-14

- Allow full 'errorstack': 'full' and abbreviated 'errorstack': True
  to show error stack with full dotted rules or just the part up to the dot
- fix packaging

spark 1.2.0 2016-05-10

- Add routine to find/show error stack
- Allow setting paring debug option on parse method
